            <h1>Experiences</h1>
            <p>I was born in Wenzhou, China, and later raised in Shanghai, where I spent most of my childhood. Growing up in these two vibrant cities, I developed a deep appreciation for both traditional and modern cultures, which has shaped my worldview in unique ways. My experiences in Shanghai, a city known for its rapid <a href="https://english.shanghai.gov.cn/en-ScenicSpots/20231205/584672cc6d044eabb5f7f6fc9049a19f.html">urbanization</a> and cultural blend, inspired my interest in urban development and the ways technology can enhance peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
